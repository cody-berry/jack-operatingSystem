Math:
	Multiply: Multiply binary! Old school way.
	Sqrt: Binary search and use x*x to see if it is less or greater than the answer.
	Division: Take 100/7. That's 2*50/7, or 4*25/7, or 8*12/7, and you get the picture. This might be bad, though. 16*6/7, 32*3/7, and just divide!
Memory:
	Use a Ram array, setting it to 0. You can now address the entire Ram.
	For Alloc and deAlloc, create a free mechanism with linked lists for the free segments.
Graphics: 
	Circles use repetitive lines. Lines use repetitive pixels. Pixels use a complex algorithm.
