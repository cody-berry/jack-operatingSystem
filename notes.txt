[1511]→	Unit 7.1: More Fun To Go
In module 7, we will look back to our compiler and add extensions! 
A extension starts with a design. Norm and Shockin were the designers, while we were the system developers.
What makes a good design good?
	1) Obvious things: Modularity, simplicity, elegance, clarity, beauty
	How do you improve multiplying and dividing? By using a hardware chip!
		Bit shifting can also speed up multiplying and dividing.
Improvements:
	1) Make a hardware chip for multiplying and dividing
	2) Add bit shifting
	3) Combine VM translator and compiler or just spot patterns in VM translator

[1042]→	Unit 7.2: More Fun To Go
How to add mass storage and network access to Hack?
	Assume that we have devices like hard disks and network cards.
		If we have things like hard disks, you can store and load programs!
		We must tinker with hardware and we need to store programs somehow.
		We must specify a simple file system.
		We must develop an OS class that loads and stores files.
		If we have network cards, we can interact with other computers!
		The chip should connect with the hardware from one end.
		The chip should also connect with a socket on your actual PC.
		We must develop an OS class that transports bits between different computers.

                                                                               .

[1728]→	⊼₂ Unit 6.2: Efficiency Matters
Numerous applications will use the OS. Make sure that these methods are as 
efficient as possible! For example, multiplication.
let x = 419*5003 is the same as let x=Math.multiply(419, 5003);
Math.multiply: Multiply binary!

⊼₂ Unit 6.1 Operating System

Typical OS services include 
	mathmetical operations
	abstract data types
	input functions
	textual output
	graphics output

System oriented services include 
	file systems
	memory managements
	drivers
	UI management
	multi-tasking
	networking
    security 

The OS classes:
1) Math provides mathematics functions like absolute value and multiply. 
2) Memory contains functions that access the RAM. 
3) Screen contains functions that can draw polygons.
4) Output will write text on the screen.
5) Keyboard interacts with the user.
6) String provides string processing services like Java's.
7) Array provides array processing services, but arrays are very similar to 
   objects.
8) Sys provides some useful algorithms.

[1737]→	Unit 6.14: Perspective
The major differences between the jack OS and regular OSs?
	1) Our OS doesn't support multithreading or multiprocessing.
	2) The kernal of OS systems is to do exactly debt.
	3) No file systems!
	4) Our OS doesn't support either command-line shells or Windows systems.
Why can our OS support anything?
	1) Users are expecetd to treat hardware and software as labrotories.
	2) Accessing OS function calls is more elaborate than a function call.
How efficient is our OS?
	1) The main is Math and Graphics, which are efficient.
	2) Division and multiplication is good. Differences:
		 1) Typically these are implemented in hardware.
		 2) These are mostly the same ideas.
	3) What about graphics? They are efficient. Differences:
		 1) Typically these are implemented by software and GPUs.

[1719]→	Unit 6.13: Project 12: Building the OS
For each operating system file that we're going to develop, we use the other n-1 executable modules to service it.
Screen, Output, String, Keyboard, Sys: Develop/test seperately using Main.jack.
Memory, Array, Math: develop/test separately, using supplied .jack/.tst/.cmp
Final test:
1. Make a copy of the directory nand2tetris/projects/11/Pong
2. copy the 8 compiled folders there
3. Test!

[1226]→	Unit 6.12: The Sys Class
Hardware contract: When the computer is reset, start with ROM[0]
VM contract: Set SP to 26 and call Sys.init
Jack contract: Program execution starts with Main.main()
OS contract: Sys.init should initialize the OS, and then call Main.main().
init():
Go through everyone who has an init function and initialize them.
Then call Main.main().
halt():
Stop the computer and freeze it.
wait():
Waits for duration milliseconds. 
error():
Gets an error code, then prints it out.

new():
let str = Array.new(maxLength)
let length = 0
return this

dispose():

length():

charAt():

setCharAt():

appendChar():

eraseLastChar():

intValue():
val = 0
for each character in the string, we compute the integer value of str[i] and make value what it is times 10 plus this integer value.
returan val

setInt():
lastDigit = val%10
c=character representing lastDigit
if the value is less then 10, then we return c as a string
otherwise, we return teh value of int2string of val/10 plus c.

newLine():

backSpace():

[1543]→	Unit 6.9: Input
RAM[24576] is the keyboard. Each keyboard press's ASCII code will be displayed in RAM[24576].
Mappings:
 , |, ", #, $, %, &, ', (, ), *, +, ,, -, ., / = 32-47
0, 1, ..., 9 = 48-57
:, ;, <, =, >, ?, @ = 58-64
A, B, C, ..., Z = 65-90
[, /, ], ^, _, ` = 91-96
a, b, c, ..., z = 97-122
{, |, }, ~ = 123-126
newline, backspace, left arrow, up arrow, right arrow, down arrow, home, end, page-up, page-down, insert, delete, esc = 128-140
f1, f2, f3, ..., f12 = 141-152
keyPressed():
This is basically Ram[24576]

readChar():
Display the cursor
While keyPressed is 0, we do nothing.
c=code of the curerntely pressed key.
While the key is down, do nothing. After that, we can give them what they pressed.

readLine():
str = empty string
repeat c=readChar(), and if it is enter, we want to display new-line and change the string. If c is backspace, there is a funcction in output which is called 'backspace'.

[1438]→	Unit 6.8: Handling Textual Output
Graphics: 256 by 512 pixels for drawing lines, circles, pixels, and things like that
Textual: 23 rows of 64 characters. This is because each character is 11 pixels high and 8 pixels wide. 2 emty columns and 1 row at the bottom. 
We have charMaps!
initMap:
charMaps is a new 127 characters. 
create(index, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k):
map = Array.new(11)
let charMaps[index] = map
map[0], map[1], map[2], map[3], map[4], map[5], map[6], map[7], map[8], map[9], map[10] = a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k
return
What about the cursor?
new line: move cursor
backspace: move cursor backwards
any other printable character: display the character, move cursor one column to right

Grab the x and y coordinates. Then grab the x modulo 16th bit of the value to the current color, somehow. 
address = 32*y + x/16
value=Memory.peek[16384 + address]
set the (x % 16)th bit of value to the current color
do Memory.poke(address, value)

init():
Already implemented: 'ram=0', static array ram
Free should be set to the heap base. Now we can use our whole heap. 
Use a linked list to keep track of available heap segments.

alloc(size):
iterate through the linked list to find a block of size size+2. keep the smallest that is greater than equal to size+2 in mind.
otherwise
block = free
free = free + size

multiply():
In Unit 6.2.

division():
The naive way is to count how many times we can add b to itself to get a, 
with a/b. The correct way is with long division. The one that we're going to 
use in our operating system is the following: Take 100/7. We don't know the 
answer, but we know it's 50*2/7. We know that's 25*2*2/7. We know that's 
about 12*2*2*2/7. We know that's 6*2*2*2*2/7. And you get the picture.

sqrt():
Binary search! Use x*x and see if it is less or greater than the answer.
