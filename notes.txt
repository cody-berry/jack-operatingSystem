[1728]→	⊼₂ Unit 6.2: Efficiency Matters
Numerous applications will use the OS. Make sure that these methods are as 
efficient as possible! For example, multiplication.
let x = 419*5003 is the same as let x=Math.multiply(419, 5003);
Math.multiply: Multiply binary!

[1459]→ ⊼₂ Unit 6.1 Operating System

Typical OS services include 
	mathmetical operations
	abstract data types
	input functions
	textual output
	graphics output

System oriented services include 
	file systems
	memory managements
	drivers
	UI management
	multi-tasking
	networking
    security 

The OS classes:
1) Math provides mathematics functions like absolute value and multiply. 
2) Memory contains functions that access the RAM. 
3) Screen contains functions that can draw polygons.
4) Output will write text on the screen.
5) Keyboard interacts with the user.
6) String provides string processing services like Java's.
7) Array provides array processing services, but arrays are very similar to 
   objects.
8) Sys provides some useful algorithms.
